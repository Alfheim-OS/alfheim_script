How to edit the Alfheim Build Script to make your own Arch based
distribution.

Alfheim Software Initiative Developers
2017 - Current

These are only suggestions you are free to edit and rebuild it as
you please.

The alfheim script in the root folder is a jumping off board for the
rest of the script and provides the license that Alfheim Linux is
released under and a simple menu so people can choose to install a
non-systemd or systemd version of the ISO. Shouldn't need editing
except to change the name of the Distribution and the Licensing, or
to add other menu options.

- scripts/alnsd -
This is where the non-systemd iso system is hosted and there are a lot
of files that can be changed in here.

- scripts/alnsd/alnsd -
This is the main script for the non-systemd build and routes to all
other scripts.  The only thing we suggest that is changed in here is
the Distribution name.  If you have anything that needs to be copied
over to the new filesystem you can include it here too, all files
should be in the skel directory.

- scripts/alnsd/build.sh -
The only part of this script that should need editing is the part of
the script that starts with ## Begin Editable Section and ends with
## End Editable Section.

- scripts/alnsd/customize_airootfs.sh -
Here we recommend changing the last line to edit the package lists.
If you remove netcfg you will not be able to connect to a network
connection other than that everything else can be removed and items
can be added, this is here to install things from the AUR instead of
pacman and so have kept it separate from the main package list.

-scripts/alnsd/isolinux.conf -
Change alfheim to whatever name you set install_dir to in build.sh.
The rest should stay the same.

- scripts/alnsd/mkinitcpio.conf -
No changes should be made to this file.

-scripts/alnsd/packages -
The only packages you should install are openrc-system, openrc-world,
and base-devel.  Everything else is on the table and can be changed to
your liking.  Note :: some packages may have a systemd dependancy and
alnsd will not install systemd.

- scripts/alnsd/pacman_final.conf and scripts/alnsd/pacman.conf -
Do not edit these files, except to comment out the testing if you don't
want to use the testing branches.

- scripts/alnsd/pre-config.sh -
The only thing here that needs to be edited is the last line.  The *.img
file should match your distribution name.  When you change this line there
are multiple files you have to change to match it ::
-> scripts/alnsd/build.sh - lines 41 and 102
-> scripts/alnsd/syslinux/archiso_sys.cfg - line 10
-> scripts/alnsd/efiboot/entries/archiso-x86_64-cd.conf - line 4
-> scripts/alnsd/efiboot/entries/archiso-x86_64-cd.conf - line 4

- scripts/alnsd/efiboot/loader.conf -
Change the Distribution name.

- scripts/alnsd/efiboot/entries/archiso-x86_64-cd.conf -
Change all references to alfheim (except line 4 as noted above) to your
distribution name.

- scripts/alnsd/efiboot/entries/archiso-x86_64-cd.conf -
Change all references to alfheim (except line 4 as noted above) to your
distribution name.

- scripts/alnsd/pacman.d -
No files in this directory should need to be edited.

- scripts/alnsd/skel -
As mentioned before any files that you want to copy over to your final
iso should be included in here and you should edit scripts/alnsd to
copy those files over.

- scripts/alnsd/syslinux/archiso_head.cfg -
Change Alfheim Linux to your distribution name.

- scripts/alnsd/syslinux/archiso_pxe.cfg -
Change all instances of Alfheim Linux to your distribution name.

- scripts/alnsd/syslinux/archiso_sys.cfg -
Change all instances of Alfheim Linux to your distribution name,
and don't forget to match line 4 to your pre-config.sh.

- scripts/alnsd/syslinux/archiso_tail.cfg -
No changes needed.

- scripts/alnsd/syslinux/archiso.cfg -
No changes needed.

- scripts/alnsd/syslinux/syslinux.cfg -
No changes needed.

- scripts/alnsd/syslinux/splash.png -
Google how to create a grub splash and replace the Afheim Linux
splash.png with your own.
