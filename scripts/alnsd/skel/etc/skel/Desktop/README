===Pacman===

Pacman will not work live correctly until you set up your local mirror. Open a terminal and run:

	sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

Uncomment your nearest server to your country/region and then run:

	sudo pacman -Syyu

This will refresh package database and allow you to install any package available.

	sudo pacman -S <package_name>

====Installation====

Make sure that any partitions required with filesystems (created) are mounted too /mnt prior to starting installer. 

A scheme such as /dev/sdx1 (root) and /dev/sdx2 /home would be mounted as follows

    sudo mount /dev/sdx1 /mnt # root partition
    sudo mkdir -p /mnt/home # create /home mount point
    # then mount /dev/sdx2
    sudo mount /dev/sdx2 /mnt/home # mount /home partition

Select install from main openbox menu [right click].

Installer Menu includes

1) Install ArchBang # transfers iso image to traget device
2) Hostname # Your given machine name default is 'archbang'
3) Hardware Clock # UTC or localtime (user preference can affect windows dual boot)
4) Config Corner [Optional] # opens file manager so user can edit any config files in new system
5) Root password # Very important as iso is password free
6) Create User # Set up new user for install and password
7) Bootloader # Grub2, Syslinux, Systemd-boot (UEFI)
