# Alfheim Linux Build Script
This is the script used to build Alfheim Linux, an Arch based Linux Operating System.

This script is written in Perl and requires Perl 5 in order to run.  At this time it also requires Arch Linux though we are working to make it Linux platform agnostic.

It allows you to build two different versions of Alfheim Linux, the preferred (and officially released version) with OpenRC instead of systemd, and a systemd version.

The easiest way to run it is to clone the git repository and ./alfheim this will give you a menu option to choose to either build the non-systemd or systemd version.
